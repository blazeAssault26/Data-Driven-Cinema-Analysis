# Data-Driven-Cinema-Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing data related to movie statistics. The workflow can be broken down into several key steps:

## Step 1: Data Import

- The initial step involves importing relevant data. We start with a dataset of movie statistics, which includes information on movie budgets, gross revenue, votes, and runtime.

## Step 2: Data Cleaning

- In this phase, we address issues related to data quality. We identify missing values, correct data types, and remove inconsistencies. For example, we find that there are missing values in the "budget" column, which need to be handled appropriately.

## Step 3: Data Exploration

- With the cleaned data, we explore its characteristics. We calculate summary statistics, such as mean and standard deviation, for variables like "votes" and "gross revenue." This helps us understand the central tendencies and spreads in the data.

## Step 4: Hypothesis Testing

- In this step, we perform hypothesis tests to determine whether relationships exist between different variables. For instance, we hypothesize that there is a positive correlation between the "budget" and "gross revenue" of movies. We conduct a Pearson correlation test to confirm this hypothesis.

## Step 5: Visualization

- Visualizations are created to illustrate insights and trends uncovered during data exploration and hypothesis testing. We generate scatter plots and correlation matrices to visually represent the relationships between variables.

## Step 6: Conclusion

- Based on our analysis, we find that there is a strong positive correlation (r = 0.74, p < 0.01) between a movie's budget and its gross revenue. This suggests that higher budgets tend to lead to higher gross revenue in the movie industry.

By following this workflow, we have gained valuable insights into the movie statistics dataset. Our conclusion supports the idea that budget plays a significant role in a movie's financial success. Filmmakers and studios can use this information to make informed decisions when planning their budgets for future projects.
